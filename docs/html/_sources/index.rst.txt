Welcome to Automating GIS-processes 2017!
=========================================

**Automating GIS-processes** -course teaches you how to do different GIS-related tasks in Python programming language. Each lesson is a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to learn
how to solve common GIS-related problems and tasks using Python tools. In the lessons we use only publicly available data which can be used and downloaded by anyone anywhere. In this course,
we assume that you know the basics of Python programming. If Python is not familiar to you, we recommend to start with our earlier course that focuses on learning the basics of Python
from `geo-python.github.io <https://geo-python.github.io>`_.

Course format
-------------

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language and working on exercises.
During Teaching Period I, the Automating GIS-processes and `Introduction to Quantitative Geology <https://github.com/Intro-Quantitative-Geology/Course-information>`_ courses met together and focused on
`learning to program in Python <https://geo-python.github.io>`_. Previously, both these courses lacked sufficient time for students to properly learn the basic concepts of programming in Python.

The computer exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using the Python language and applying those skills to various GIS related problems.
Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks. At the end of the exercises, you may be asked to submit answers
to relevant questions, some related plots, and/or Python codes you have written or used. You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other students
on the laboratory exercises, however the laboratory summary write-ups that you submit must be completed individually and must clearly reflect your own work.
